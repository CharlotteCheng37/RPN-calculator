## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnCalc` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a
   dodecahedron?  (Note: `edgeLength` is a parameter of the formula and should be parsed as a
   variable.)
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edgeLength 2 ^ *`

   Answer: 7

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: 2

## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: The hardest part was implementing RpnParser because I didnâ€™t fully understand the
   concepts of parsing and tokens at first. After looking up examples and reading more about how
   expression parsing works, it finally made sense and I was able to finish it.
